# BreezyBox shell demo for esp32s3

This is an example/demo project for [BreezyBox](https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezybox), a mini-shell ESP-IDF component for ESP32-S3.

The BreezyBox component leaves the display and other board configuration details to the user's firmware project, providing mainly the vterm/vfs features, and some shell commands. This particular example/demo project supports only one specific dev board: [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7B](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-lcd-7b.htm) (no affiliation). But you can see how all the parts connect, and adapt it to your display/board, or just copy some code snippets from here.
